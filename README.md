# Getting Started with Windows Autopilot: A Deployment Overview for IT Admins
Windows Autopilot simplifies the deployment of new devices by automating setup and configuration. This guide provides a high-level overview for IT administrators looking to adopt Autopilot in enterprise environments, reducing manual IT involvement.

## What Is Windows Autopilot?
Windows Autopilot is a cloud service that helps IT teams set up new Windows computers quickly and easily. It prepares devices to be ready right out of the box by automatically applying company settings and apps when users first turn them on.

## Key Benefits

- **Zero-touch provisioning**  
  Devices can be shipped directly to employees and configured on first boot.

- **Consistent experience**  
  Ensures company branding, policies, and apps are applied consistently.

- **Seamless integration**  
  Works with Microsoft Intune, Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), and Microsoft 365.

## Prerequisites

To use Autopilot, you’ll need:

- Devices registered with the Windows Autopilot service
- Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)
- Microsoft Intune or another supported MDM service
- Windows 10/11 Pro, Enterprise, or Education editions

## Setup Overview

1. **Gather device hardware IDs**
   - Export CSV file using PowerShell:
     ```powershell
     Get-WindowsAutopilotInfo -OutputFile AutoPilotHWID.csv
     ```

2. **Upload to Microsoft Endpoint Manager**
   - Go to **Devices > Enroll devices > Windows enrollment > Devices**
   - Import the CSV file

3. **Create an Autopilot Deployment Profile**
   - Define out-of-box experience (OOBE) settings (e.g. privacy options, account type, etc.)

4. **Assign the deployment profile to devices**

5. **Ship devices to users**
   - On the first boot, devices configure automatically based on assigned profiles and policies.

## Security Considerations

- Ensure multi-factor authentication (MFA) is enabled in Azure AD
- Use Windows Hello for Business for passwordless sign-in
- Enable BitLocker encryption policies during deployment

---

## Example Use Case

> *A company hires 50 remote employees. Instead of pre-configuring each laptop, IT registers devices with Autopilot, assigns a deployment profile, and ships them directly to employees. When the laptops power on, they auto-configure, install necessary apps, and enforce company security policies.*
