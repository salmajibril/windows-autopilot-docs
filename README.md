# Getting Started with Windows Autopilot: A Deployment Overview for IT Admins

Windows Autopilot simplifies the deployment of new devices by automating setup and configuration without reimaging. This guide provides a high-level overview for IT administrators looking to adopt Autopilot in enterprise environments.

## üîπ What Is Windows Autopilot?

Windows Autopilot is a cloud-based provisioning tool designed to streamline the deployment process for new Windows 10/11 devices. It enables IT teams to preconfigure and enroll devices into Microsoft Endpoint Manager (Intune) with minimal touch.

## ‚úÖ Key Benefits

- **Zero-touch provisioning**  
  Devices can be shipped directly to employees and configured on first boot.

- **Consistent experience**  
  Ensures company branding, policies, and apps are applied consistently.

- **Seamless integration**  
  Works with Microsoft Intune, Azure AD, and Microsoft 365.

## üöÄ Setup Overview

1. **Gather device hardware IDs**
   - Export CSV file using PowerShell:
     ```powershell
     Get-WindowsAutopilotInfo -OutputFile AutoPilotHWID.csv
     ```

2. **Upload to Microsoft Endpoint Manager**
   - Go to **Devices > Enroll devices > Windows enrollment > Devices**
   - Import the CSV file

3. **Create an Autopilot Deployment Profile**
   - Define out-of-box experience (OOBE) settings (e.g., skip privacy, account type)

4. **Assign profile to devices**

5. **Ship device to user**
   - On boot, the device configures automatically using cloud-based policies

## üîí Security Considerations

- Ensure multi-factor authentication (MFA) is enabled in Azure AD
- Use Windows Hello for Business for passwordless sign-in
- Enable BitLocker encryption policies during deployment

---

## üß© Example Use Case

> *A company hires 50 remote employees. Instead of pre-configuring each laptop, IT registers devices with Autopilot, assigns a deployment profile, and ships them directly to employees. When the laptops power on, they auto-configure, install necessary apps, and enforce company security policies.*
